      "howToAgeLessContent": "<strong>Physical activity has effects that oppose those of aging.</strong> 1- Practiced regularly, physical activity slows the decrease in muscle mass related to advancing age. 2- Simultaneously, regular physical activity limits the increase in fat mass and associated metabolic problems, such as glucose intolerance, which prevents diabetes. 3- Regular physical activity also preserves cardiovascular and respiratory functions. Even when started at an advanced age, it will have positive effects on health.",

      "agingProblemsTitle": "Aging Problems",
      "agingProblemsContent": "<strong>Fall risks</strong> are a real problem for elderly people. Muscle loss, impaired sensory capacities, medication intake, orthostatic hypotension, ... are factors that promote falls. Prevention is the only way to reduce risks by adapting one's environment. But regularly practicing physical activity helps preserve reflexes and muscle mass. Elderly people walk with increased anterior pelvic rotation (downward) and with increased lumbar lordosis. This postural change is usually due to a combination of weak abdominal muscles, tension in hip flexor muscles and increased abdominal fat. <strong>Pressure sore risk</strong> is another problem for elderly and people with reduced mobility. A pressure sore is a wound resulting from tissue hypoxia caused by excessive and prolonged pressure over time, on a hard surface, of a bony prominence. The sacrum is typically most affected in sitting position when the person slides in their chair. Tissue crushing causes narrowing or even occlusion of skin capillaries, which can cause a wound.",
      "goodSupportTitle": "It is important that the person sits on good support",
      "image3": "/articles/elderly-03.jpg",
      "goodSupportContent": "If the seat is too hard, the contact area is very reduced and all the weight then rests only on this small surface, which increases pressure. If the surface is too soft, the pelvis sinks excessively into the seat, but pressure concentrates at body protrusion points (sacrum and ischium), and increases at these locations. Moreover, the pelvis is then unfortunately completely immobilized. Good support is one where the person sinks slightly but where they are supported everywhere in the same way. The contact surface is larger and the pressure, evenly distributed, is therefore much less.",
      "whyNoaTitle": "Why sit on the NOA cushion?",
      "whyNoaContent": "<strong>To exercise gently</strong> The NOA cushion keeps you moving. It allows you to maintain tone naturally throughout the day. It strengthens your muscles gently thanks to barely perceptible instability. By maintaining the three curves naturally without effort, the NOA cushion stimulates your general metabolism (see photo). <strong>To reduce tissue pressure during prolonged sitting</strong> The cushion evenly distributes pressure over the entire contact surface and preserves skin tissues. <strong>To improve brain activity</strong> Thanks to the cushion, the head repositions well above the shoulders and the vessels that supply the brain are no longer compressed. It thus improves your blood circulation and therefore cell and brain oxygenation.",

Intervertebral discs play a crucial role as support points for movement and shock absorbers for the vertebrae. When you jump, when you have poor posture... or simply when you sit, your intervertebral discs compress to protect your vertebrae by absorbing the shock or excess pressure.",
      "howItWorksTitle": "How does it work?",
      "howItWorksContent": "The intervertebral disc is composed of an outer fibrous ring and a gelatinous nucleus. This nucleus, made of more than 90% water, generates internal hydraulic pressure. This hydraulic pressure varies depending on the positioning of the vertebrae, thus on the position adopted and movements performed. Throughout the day, depending on your position, this hydraulic pressure empties the nucleus of its water, which reduces its shock-absorbing capacity.",

And each day spent in sitting position reproduces the same constraints which in the long run can have a negative impact on your health.",
      "whyNoaBackTitle": "Why adopt dynamic sitting with NOA for your back?",
      "whyNoaBackContent": "The dynamic sitting provided by the NOA cushion stimulates the erector muscles of the spine, which reduces pressure on intervertebral discs. It thus allows them to ensure their shock-absorbing role longer. It also allows better vascularization of this entire body area. It therefore promotes oxygen transport in the blood, essential for proper functioning of back muscles. This better vascularization also nourishes the intervertebral discs. Moreover, adopting dynamic sitting with the NOA cushion will help you become aware of your back position. It will allow you to regain a healthy sitting position respecting the three morphological curves of the back and neck.",
      "image4": "/articles/back-woman.jpg",
      "whyNoaHealthTitle": "Why adopt dynamic sitting with NOA for your health?",
      "whyNoaHealthContent": "Beyond that, the dynamic sitting provided by the NOA cushion prevents the body from entering lethargy. Maintaining correct posture while sitting requires a certain effort that we are unable to maintain over time. We must constantly reposition ourselves to avoid a position that becomes harmful to our health. In sitting position, the spine no longer has its three natural curves, the pelvis spontaneously tilts backward, the discs are pinched forward, the nucleus slides backward, the viscera and vessels are compressed. Even if they seem minimal, the cushion allows maintenance and compensation exercises through the movements it generates. These imperceptible movements force your muscles to work during all hours spent sitting. In doing so, the cushion will strengthen, among other things, your back muscles, an effective way to prevent back pain and improve organ function. Your overall health will be improved."

      "physiologyContent": "From a physiological point of view, the nucleus of intervertebral discs is composed of 90% water, hence its shock-absorbing properties. The only non-vascularized tissue, the nucleus deflates when compressed. It only reinflates by pressure reduction (osmosis) when we are lying down.

      "mechanicalTitle": "Mechanical consequences",
      "mechanicalContent": "Abnormal stress on the child's and adolescent's spine during the sensitive period of their growth influences their back's future and promotes lower back pain in adulthood. The child's trunk muscles are not yet sufficiently developed and powerful to support without great effort maintaining sitting position for hours. Their attention in class decreases because it is then more directed towards this intense muscular effort imposed on them, causing distraction. A well-adjusted seat will help them by reducing the muscular constraints and mental effort necessary to sit for a long time. The child will fidget less in their chair. By moving, children often only seek to compensate for muscular tensions.",
      "neurologicalTitle": "Neurological consequences",
      "neurologicalContent": "In the child in class, there are two types of behaviors in response to the constraints of prolonged sitting position: the \"well-behaved\" child who doesn't move but ends up slumping in their seat; the \"restless\" child who keeps moving, is distracted and unfocused. Between 6 and 12 years old, the child is in full motor development. They still need to refine their body schema. Their brain uses tactile, proprioceptive, vestibular and visual integration mechanisms that lead to either a muscular response or relaxation.",
      "whyOfferTitle": "Why offer a cushion to your children?",
      "whyOfferContent": "The NOA cushion helps maintain the three natural curves of the spine in sitting position (see right photo) and dynamize sitting. Spontaneously, when sitting, the pelvis tends to tilt backward (see left photo). The cushion facilitates repositioning the pelvis forward (see right photo). This correct and natural posture is essential for maintaining attention, alertness and listening and to <strong>promote task perseverance</strong>. Indeed, repositioning the head above the shoulders promotes good brain vascularization, beneficial for good concentration and better learning.",

      "image2": "/articles/pregnancy-02.jpg",
      "phenomenaContent": "The uterus volume increases and therefore, stretching of the ligaments that support it in the pelvis occurs. Pregnant women may feel pain in the lower abdomen and legs. During pregnancy, hormones are also responsible for physiological changes. Relaxin is a hormone that promotes relaxation of connective tissues, ligaments and tendons, to help vaginal delivery, but which causes instability in pelvic statics. The center of gravity shifts forward due to weight gain from the uterus and breasts. Back muscles must constantly work to rebalance the pelvis, hence dorsal muscle contractures and pain. Dorsal and abdominal muscles are antagonists. But they are also complementary to support the trunk, hence the importance of balance between the two. Mechanical constraints undergone by the musculoskeletal system of load-bearing joints such as the lumbar spine, lumbosacral joint, sacroiliac joints and pubic symphysis cause a series of pains that can be improved by using the cushion.",
      "circulationContent": "Pregnant women risk circulatory problems during pregnancy. The uterus weight compresses the inferior vena cava that drains blood from the legs to the heart, which causes retention and can lead to formation of varicose veins, hemorrhoids, especially in case of sedentary lifestyle. Ischial support in sitting position causes poorer vascularization since veins and vessels pass through there. The perineum is put to the test during pregnancy. The uterus and baby's weight press heavily on the perineum, a true floor that holds the viscera. It weakens and relaxes from the 12th week. It is important to strengthen it.",
      "whySitTitle": "Why sit on the cushion?",
      "whySitContent": "A first benefit lies in posture improvement. To improve spinal statics, in sitting position, you must exercise self-lengthening upward while avoiding leaning against the backrest. The cushion reactivates spinal erector muscles and allows a natural position with improvement of the three spinal curves. An additional benefit to sitting on the cushion: you do gentle fitness! Strengthening deep muscles such as the transverse is possible thanks to the cushion. The imperceptible instability and automatic correction of our posture on the cushion makes our deep abdominal belt work without feeling it. An additional benefit of the cushion is at the perineum level. The cushion's shape and dynamics help pregnant women better feel their perineum to better strengthen it. It reduces pressure on this muscle which allows better vascularization, better freedom of movement to contract it but also help in relaxing it at the time of delivery. In immediate postpartum, it allows resting the pelvic floor by its cut-out shape that prevents pressure on a possible episiotomy or temporary sensitivity related to delivery.",
      "finalContent": "It is therefore an ally for pregnant women for comfort during pregnancy but also in immediate postpartum and beyond. It improves blood circulation by reducing pressure on the pelvic floor and by imperceptible pelvis movements. The cushion bridges between body asymmetry, sometimes increased by ligament instability related to pregnancy, and furniture symmetry. Adopting the cushion throughout the day will help pregnant women experience their pregnancy more serenely as well as the period after pregnancy."

    "subtitle": "The Noa cushion, for healthy and dynamic sitting",
    "intro": "Are you sitting comfortably? Whether working from home, at the office, or at school, we spend an average of 8 to 12 hours a day on a chair.",
    "problem": "However, prolonged static sitting creates back problems. But not only that. It also slows blood circulation, and therefore the supply of oxygen throughout the body. It creates attention disorders. And it also increases the risk of major organ function problems.",
    "solution": "Think about adopting a dynamic sitting position.<br/>Designed and made in Belgium, the Noa cushion reduces the negative effects of prolonged sitting on your health. Its ultra-light air cushion induces a dynamic sitting position by creating slight instability, which helps you reactivate your muscles, without necessarily realizing it.",
