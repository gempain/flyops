- Use @tanstack/react-query, react-hook-form and zod validation when possible
- Api routes should use zod validators
- Never expose internal errors to the frontend unless we control the message
- use native shadcn/ui components as much as possible
- when using shadcn components, install them via the CLI instead of creating them by hand
- when possible dot not use styling magic numbers / values but instead customize Tailwind's theme
